2016-07-01T19:37:00, Stop scan, protractor reads 0.5 deg at zenith - adjusted back to 0 deg after replacing stripped screw on coupler,JXK
2016-07-01T15:22:19, At some point overnight N2 stopped flowing which is ok because it didn't rain,JXK
2016-06-30T20:57:25, Start scan. Replaced electronics lid screws with M4. Looked like rain so turned N2 on,JXK
2016-06-30T19:21:56, Stop scan. Protractor reads 0.1 deg at zenith,JXK
2016-06-29T23:52:07, Start overnight scan w/ new electronics order,JXK
2016-06-29T23:38:11, Remove IF amp and 10dB atten,JXK
2016-06-29T23:21:44, Horn > LNA > BP > 2nd amp > Mixer > 10dB atten > IF > out. Fewer connectors as well,JXK
