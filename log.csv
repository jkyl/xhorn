2016-07-09T00:01:58, set scanning with short secured cable and without cal stares (n2 tube would interfere) will take pics also no IF or atten,JXK
2016-07-08T23:40:27, unexpectadly bad. trying again without IF or any attenuators still short cable,JXK
2016-07-08T23:32:57, not any better with IF-2dB. now going to remove IF and do 1dB,JXK
2016-07-08T23:25:04, that trial was worse than the long sma. going to add the IF amp before -2dB just a shot in the dark,JXK
2016-07-08T23:13:32, Too much attenuation=more noise and much worse R. Now try with only -2dB keeping short sma,JXK 
2016-07-08T23:04:16, R improved with shorter cable. judging by the std in the good range (inds 800 1600). now try with 10db attenuator before short sma,JXK
2016-07-08T22:52:12, looks like the last trial gave the smoothest R. Now a scan with that setup + secured shorter sma>roach also lots of cloud cover,JXK

2016-07-08T20:23:56, stop scan. zenith@0.5 deg 50@49.5. going to swap some cables and attenuators to try and smooth out R,JXK
2016-07-07T19:30:32, resume scan,JXK
2016-07-07T19:16:14, stop scan - previous angle measurements have not changed. rebalanced by shifting position of large vice from south to north side of roach. everything looks dry despite rain. will maintain 10scfh flow rate.,JXK
2016-07-06T18:31:09, resume scan while i come up with rebalancing scheme.,JXK
2016-07-06T18:14:59, stop scan. zenith read 0.2 deg but 50 deg read 49.1 deg. Inconsistent offsets - 30 & 40 are bang on but 20 is not. Need to rebalance.Slight condensation on inside of mylar - nitrogen shut off at some point. going to increase the flow rate to 1 scfh.,JXK
2016-07-04T19:45:55, Resume scan - want to see if roach resetting changes spectrum,JXK
2016-07-04T19:24:01, Stop scan protractor 0.4 deg at zenith turned N2 on,JXK
2016-07-03T21:18:58, Resume scan with prior front end arrangement,JXK
2016-07-03T18:26:35, Stop scan. Protractor reads 0.4 deg at zenith. Going to look at front end components with spectrum analyzer,JXK
2016-07-01T20:58:38, Resume scan,JXK
2016-07-01T19:37:00, Stop scan. Protractor reads 0.5 deg at zenith - adjusted back to 0 deg after replacing stripped screw on coupler,JXK
2016-07-01T15:22:19, At some point overnight N2 stopped flowing which is ok because it didn't rain,JXK
2016-06-30T20:57:25, Start scan. Replaced electronics lid screws with M4. Looked like rain so turned N2 on,JXK
2016-06-30T19:21:56, Stop scan. Protractor reads 0.1 deg at zenith,JXK
2016-06-29T23:52:07, Start overnight scan w/ new electronics order,JXK
2016-06-29T23:38:11, Remove IF amp and 10dB atten,JXK
2016-06-29T23:21:44, Horn > LNA > BP > 2nd amp > Mixer > 10dB atten > IF > out. Fewer connectors as well,JXK 
2016-06-29T22:36:14, Remove 10dB from front of IF amp,JXK
2016-06-29T22:27:23, Everything the same,JXK
2016-06-29T22:03:04, Stop in order to rearrange electronics for some test runs,JXK
