2016-08-23T16:50:11, resume scan without baffle.,JXK
2016-08-23T16:36:16, stopped scan to remove baffle.,JXK
2016-08-22T22:23:54, scanning with roach off of shaft and other improvements.,JXK
2016-07-17T16:33:17, weathered the storm just fine. wiped down outside of mylar with kimwipe while scanning. leaving n2 on today (supposed to rain again after noon).,JXK
2016-07-15T21:25:36, That seemed to work. all angles within .5 deg. Lets keep scanning while we wait for new attenuators,JXK
2016-07-14T20:08:07, failed again. now only doing re-init once every 20 scans.,JXK
2016-07-14T18:33:09, failed again. go_log is not showing any errors (nohup's fault?),JXK
2016-07-14T17:17:05, set scanning after another failure. hard reset roach and checked all connections. everything seems fine..,JXK
2016-07-14T15:30:51, set scanning after another failure. go_log.txt reports that first the roach could not connect then during the very long retry loop it reported "too many files open" despite the close() statement in in_out.py. I believe this error was thrown in katcp_wrapper though. I put in a time.sleep(5) in the retry loop and have it only entering the loop for a RuntimeError.,JXK
2016-07-13T22:09:39, implemented retry in spec reinit. if it continues to stop it is not bc of reinit failure,JXK
2016-07-13T19:25:33, set scanning again after another mystery stop. will rain soon.,JXK
2016-07-13T14:50:12, set scanning in AM after mystery stop yesterday afternoon. Seems to have weathered rain ok despite n2 shutoff (again). despite leakage its a good idea to open main valve all the way and throttle with regulator,JXK
2016-07-12T22:13:56, set scanning (nocal nohome) with 6db on both sides of short cable after measuring total power(?) with SA and removing counterweight (seemed to be causing sticking),JXK
2016-07-12T21:02:15, short cable + 6dB both retry,JXK
2016-07-12T20:56:58, short cable + 6dB box + 9dB roach,JXK
2016-07-12T20:47:28, short cable + 3dB box + 12dB (10+2) roach,JXK
2016-07-12T20:38:32, short cable + 3dB box side + 9dB roach side also new rigid coax after IF (broke other one),JXK
2016-07-12T20:28:34, short cable + 6dB box side + 9dB roach side,JXK
2016-07-12T20:21:21, short cable + 6dB both sides + IF amp,JXK
2016-07-12T20:14:21, short cable + 6dB roach side + 3dB box side + IF amp,JXK
2016-07-12T20:07:27, short cable + 3dB both sides + IF amp,JXK
2016-07-12T19:59:39, short cable + 3dB atten on both sides,JXK
2016-07-12T19:54:02, short cable + 3dB atten on roach side,JXK
2016-07-12T19:49:19, cal scan with short cable + no atten,JXK
2016-07-11T22:12:47, scan stopped prematurely. must have been heat killed laptop,JXK
2016-07-11T20:37:46, analysis code issues. setting scanning while i fix,JXK
2016-07-11T20:30:34, Waited for everything to warm up again before taking a few cal trials,JXK
2016-07-10T22:47:11, noticed that roach was changing state. added reset to scan.go() while loop. decided to redo the cal measurements from 2 days ago with some updated ratio plotting code. noticed that 2nd amp's output sma connector very loose and affecting spectrum. tightened connector but managed to snap off LO's +15v connector. redid the solder. caused a short bc new solder contacted the LO case. redid solder again. was too dark to work by the time i finished.,JXK
2016-07-09T00:01:58, set scanning with short secured cable and without cal stares (n2 tube would interfere) will take pics also no IF or atten,JXK
2016-07-08T23:40:27, unexpectadly bad. trying again without IF or any attenuators still short cable,JXK
2016-07-08T23:32:57, not any better with IF-2dB. now going to remove IF and do 1dB,JXK6
2016-07-08T23:25:04, that trial was worse than the long sma. going to add the IF amp before -2dB just a shot in the dark,JXK
2016-07-08T23:13:32, Too much attenuation=more noise and much worse R. Now try with only -2dB keeping short sma,JXK 
2016-07-08T23:04:16, R improved with shorter cable. judging by the std in the good range (inds 800 1600). now try with 10db attenuator before short sma,JXK
2016-07-08T22:52:12, looks like the last trial gave the smoothest R. Now a scan with that setup + secured shorter sma>roach also lots of cloud cover,JXK
2016-07-08T22:30:23, horn>lna>bp>amp>mix>longsma>roach redo,JXK
2016-07-08T22:25:43, horn>lna>bp>amp>mix>IFamp>longsma>roach redo,JXK
2016-07-08T22:20:22, horn>lna>bp>amp>mix>IFamp>-10dB>longsma>roach redo bc weird feature from clouds,JXK
2016-07-08T21:16:03, horn>lna>bp>amp>mix>IFamp>-10dB>longsma>roach,JXK

2016-07-08T20:50:04, horn>lna>bp>amp>mix>longsma>roach,JXK
2016-07-08T20:23:56, stop scan. zenith@0.5 deg 50@49.5. going to swap some cables and attenuators to try and smooth out R,JXK
2016-07-07T19:30:32, resume scan,JXK
2016-07-07T19:16:14, stop scan - previous angle measurements have not changed. rebalanced by shifting position of large vice from south to north side of roach. everything looks dry despite rain. will maintain 10scfh flow rate.,JXK
2016-07-06T18:31:09, resume scan while i come up with rebalancing scheme.,JXK
2016-07-06T18:14:59, stop scan. zenith read 0.2 deg but 50 deg read 49.1 deg. Inconsistent offsets - 30 & 40 are bang on but 20 is not. Need to rebalance.Slight condensation on inside of mylar - nitrogen shut off at some point. going to increase the flow rate to 1 scfh.,JXK
2016-07-04T19:45:55, Resume scan - want to see if roach resetting changes spectrum,JXK
2016-07-04T19:24:01, Stop scan protractor 0.4 deg at zenith turned N2 on,JXK
2016-07-03T21:18:58, Resume scan with prior front end arrangement,JXK
2016-07-03T18:26:35, Stop scan. Protractor reads 0.4 deg at zenith. Going to look at front end components with spectrum analyzer,JXK
2016-07-01T20:58:38, Resume scan,JXK
2016-07-01T19:37:00, Stop scan. Protractor reads 0.5 deg at zenith - adjusted back to 0 deg after replacing stripped screw on coupler,JXK
2016-07-01T15:22:19, At some point overnight N2 stopped flowing which is ok because it didn't rain,JXK
2016-06-30T20:57:25, Start scan. Replaced electronics lid screws with M4. Looked like rain so turned N2 on,JXK
2016-06-30T19:21:56, Stop scan. Protractor reads 0.1 deg at zenith,JXK
2016-06-29T23:52:07, Start overnight scan w/ new electronics order,JXK
2016-06-29T23:38:11, Remove IF amp and 10dB atten,JXK
2016-06-29T23:21:44, Horn > LNA > BP > 2nd amp > Mixer > 10dB atten > IF > out. Fewer connectors as well,JXK 
2016-06-29T22:36:14, Remove 10dB from front of IF amp,JXK
