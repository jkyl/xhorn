<H2>August 19, 2016 - Cone calibrator reflection measurement</H2>

<H3>Intro</H3>

Here are measurements of the reflections from the VHP eccosorb cone
calibrator. We constructed an AN-73 lined lid for the box and made measurements
with and without it.

<p>
<hr>
<H3>Method</H3>

<b>Figure 1</b> shows the setup. 

<p>With the baffled corrugated horn staring at the calibrator, we hook up the
corrugated horn to the signal generator and transmit at 10 GHz. We receive with
a relatively high gain pyramidal horn and read out through the same amplifier /
mixer / ROACH chain. We chop the transmit signal and plot the received on/off
differece spectrum. This gives us awesome s/n in real time on any signal coming
out of the box.

<p>We turn the signal generator down to -80 dBm and put the pyramidal horn right
in the aperture of the corrugated horn. We note the received differential power
in ADU^2>. (We checked that swapping out the pyramidal horn for a bare WR-10
waveguide that the decrease in ADU^2 is roughly consistent with the decrease in
aperture area.) We make a small correction to this power by multiplying by 1.3,
the ratio of aperture areas of the horns, Acorrug/Apyramidal. We take this to be
the total power available to be absorbed/reflected, which we denote <b>Ptot</b>.

<p>Then we put the eccosorb box back in place and crank the signal generator
up to 0 dBm. (We checked that with 60 dB of attenuation in
front of the amplifiers, cranking up to 0 dBm results in the expected 10^6 increase in
ADU^2.) We then measure in 13 different locations around the box at a distance
of 18'' from a fixed point centered on the horn. The reflected radiation is in
  mostly in the same polarization as the broadcast radiation. We spot checked
  that turning the pyramidal horn by 90 deg reduced the received power by &gt;10x.

grid (with wrapping enforced in longitude), and expressed in dB. The markers

<p>To obtain the total reflectivity, we divide the interpolated Pmeas /
  (Ptot*1e8) by the aperture area of the pyramidal horn (18.125 in^2) and
  integrate over the sphere (radius 18''). This is equivalent to integrating the
  received power in ADU^2 / in^2 over the area of the sphere and dividing by the
  total transmitted power in ADU^2. The total reflectivity is shown in the text
  annotation in Figure 1.

<p>All the reflections show a decrease when adding the absorber lined lid except
  for the location closest to directly behind the horn (actually at lat=-20). We
  interpret this as a backlobe at approx. -67 dB. We therefore try excluding
  this point from the integration, instead interpolating over it. This should
  best estimate the reflectivity of the calibrator box itself. Including this
  point estimates the total response of the horn to power originating outside
  the box. <b>Table 1</b> lists the total reflectivity / response.

<p>One thing that is not measured is a direct reflection from the corrugated
  horn, off the cones, and directly back into the horn. Given the geometry, it
  seems unlikely that this reflection would be favored over others. I tried
  putting the horn on the VNA to measure S11, but there is no time domain option
  and I could not separate out the reflections off the cones from reflections at
  shorter delays. We instead reversed the experimental setup here and broadcast
  with the pyramidal horn and received with the corrugated horn. We stuck the
  pyramidal horn almost inside the box, as close to the horn as we could, and
  shined it all around inside the box, pointed at the cones. We never saw any
  received power greater than -60 dB.

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

The calibrator with a baffled horn and no lid is very black, with reflections =
-57 dB. The VHP-12 eccosorb cones have an expected reflectivity of ~-65 dB at 10
GHz (see <a href="VHP.pdf">here</a>).  Adding the absorber lined lid reduces the
power making it out of the box to -63 dB.  There is probably a backlobe with
total integrated power of around -65 dB as well.
