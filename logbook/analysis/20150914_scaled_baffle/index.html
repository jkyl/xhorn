<H2>September 14, 2015 - Two New Baffle Designs</H2>

<p>


<hr>
<p>
  Comparison of the previous baffle with two new designs: one with a smaller radius than the first design which intersects the beam at 18 deg, and another shorter one that restores the previous intersection angle of 28 deg. 
<p>
The 18 deg baffle profile exhibits assymetric response about 0 deg, modest attenuation out to ~30 deg, and high response beyond that. The scaled down 28 deg baffle is more symmetric and performs significantly better all the way out to 60 deg. All profiles show reflections around ~80 deg.

  Comparison of three unbaffled profiles and one very simple baffled profile as a control. Evidently changing from horizontal to vertical polarization has little effect on the unbaffled profile. <i>All subsequent trials were performed with vertical polarity</i>. What looks like higher response at 50 deg is just one data point. The addition of a foam-only conical baffle has negligible to damaging effects - suggesting that our aluminum cylinder+rolled lip design is worth pursuing.

  Comparison of 4 baffled profiles. <ul>
    <li>"in front" and "behind" refer to the difference between <a href=http://caelum.uchicago.edu/~xhorn/photos/20150915_new_baffles/tn/IMG_0021.jpg.html>trial #1,</a> where the back piece of an-73 was situated in front of the aperture, and <a href=http://caelum.uchicago.edu/~xhorn/photos/20150915_new_baffles/tn/IMG_0041.jpg.html>trial #2,</a> where we moved it behind the opening in order to reduce flux through the <a href=http://caelum.uchicago.edu/~xhorn/photos/20150828_baffle_test/tn/IMG_2560.jpg.html>gap</a> between the aperture and the foam. This also served to increase the intersection angle by about 2 degrees. While this lowered the response outside 45 deg, it seems to have done worse around 30 deg.</li>
<p>
  <li>For the next trial we used a smaller diameter (same length) baffle such that it began to intersect the beam at 18 deg, in an attempt to increase the attenuation at smaller angles. We also added <a href=http://caelum.uchicago.edu/~xhorn/photos/20150915_new_baffles/tn/IMG_0058.jpg.html>a ring of aluminum sheet</a> sealed around the edges with aluminum tape behind the back piece of foam, in order to reduce any leakage from behind the baffle. We saw increased response at all angles greater than about 30 deg, and also distortion of the axial symmetry likely due to <a href=http://caelum.uchicago.edu/~xhorn/photos/20150915_new_baffles/tn/IMG_0057.jpg.html>overlapping foam</a> (see <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>).</li>
<p>
  <li>Intersecting the baffle so closely seems to divert power unpredictably - looking at the unbaffled beam we see that power is only -15dB at 18 deg, so introducing reflections this close is unwise. For the next trial we shrunk the length of the baffle so as to return to the original angle of 28 deg, with the added advantage of a more compact baffle. This trial yielded the best results so far - attenuation all the way to 60 degrees, reaching a <b>maximum attenuation of 15dB at ~50 deg</b>. Seeing as it doesn't matter in terms of radiant intensity from baffle reflections how large or small the baffle is (angle held equal), it makes sense to make it as compact as possible in order to minimize nonuniformities.

  A plot of the differences between each baffled profile and the vertical polarity unbaffled profile (lower means more attenuation). Clearly the scaled down baffle has the most consistent performance. Interestingly, all perform poorly at angles >60 deg. We know that reflections dominate around 80deg, but somehow all of the baffles have higher response ~20 deg on either side.

  All profiles are normalized and centered with a gaussian fit. While the 18 deg baffle profile may seem to be just off-center and low, it's really as centered as it will get, according to the gaussian fit of all points <=15 deg. Iterating the fit again actually moves it further right. <p>
