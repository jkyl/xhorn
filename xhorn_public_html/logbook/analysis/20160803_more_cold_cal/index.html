<H2>August 3, 2016 - More cold load calibration</H2>

<H3>Intro</H3>
I performed a series of cold load calbration trials using LN2-soaked pyramidal absorber in 
a wooden box, with the same procedure as <a href="../20160801_cold_load_cal">before</a>. I 
wanted to test the hypothesis that standing waves due to reflections off the room's walls 
and/or the absorber box were the source of all the structure that we saw in the ratio and 
in the baseline-subtracted calibrated spectra. 
<p>
The trials took place over two days. The first day I attempted to replicate the results from 
<a href="../20160801_cold_load_cal">Chris's trials</a>, and then remove the forebaffle. The 
second day I wanted to see the effect of scooting the horn slightly closer to the load - after 
removing the baffle on the first day, I noticed that the edge of the bench was anterior to the 
aperture of the horn. Finally I attempted to shield the horn from room reflections using not 
the baffle but an enclosure of eccosorb sheets surrounding the back and sides of the horn. 
<p>

<H3>Procedure</H3>
The procedure is to thoroughly spray the absorber with LN2, position it as close as possible to the 
edge of the bench, and immediately begin integrating while frequency switching. I used the same 
integration scheme as before, namely <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<tt>
lab_spec.integrate(s, int_time=960, LO_freq=[9.445,9.5,9.555], LO_time=2)</tt><p>
Tsys is calculated as (y-intercept / slope) of a linear fit between two points of "known" (really
tuned) temperature on a temperature/power plot. Points in between these two can thus be assigned
a temperature based on their measured power. We calculate T(f) for each channel of each measured spectrum,
then fit each to a 4th order polynomial and subtract. Finally we calculate the mean of these residuals. 
We also calculate the "ratio" as (Pcold - Phot) / (Pintermediate - Pcold). If Tsys and G are sufficiently
flat in frequency and linear with input power, this ratio should also be featureless. 
<p>
There are two days represented here, each with 3 succesful trials. On day 1, the order was as follows:
<ul><li>baffle on<li>baffle off<li>baffle off + flexible SMA</ul>
The reason for the flexible SMA was due to a crack in the original rigid SMA between the LNA and
amp box that I noticed after the second trial. I had a lot of trouble on this day due to up/downlink
timeouts between my laptop and the roach. I switched over to sundog which gave rise to a host of other 
problems which have since been resolved. 
<p>
On day 2, the order was as follows:
<ul><li>baffle off<li>baffle off + scooted forward<li>baffle off + scooted forward 
+ eccosorb enclosure</ul>All trials on this day were with the flexible SMA.

<H3>Results</H3>

<p>
You can clearly see in 1a how drastically the scale had to be adjusted to
compensate for the warm Tcold, because the errors have been exaggerated too.

<b>Figure 3</b> shows the mean Tsys with order-4 polyfit subtracted on day 1. 
<p>
Looks like there are ~300 MHz (~1 meter) RF standing waves in panels a and b. There is also a big IF 
feature at about 900 MHz in panel b - not sure what this could be, as the crack in the SMA after 
the LNA ought to show up in RF if anything. Most tellingly, there are unmistakably ~60 MHz (~5 meter) 
RF standing waves in c with the baffle off. Strongly suggests that side/backlobes are picking up coherent
room reflections.

<p>
The IF features visible in figure 3b have gone away, and we still see those 5 meter standing waves in a and b. 
They have largely disappeared in c with the addition of the eccosorb enclosure.  There still looks to be some RF
structure in c corresponding to about 1 meter (approximately the scale of the calibrator box. It is unfortunately
impossible to tell how much of an effect the baffle has on suppressing room reflections due to how noisy that 
trial turned out to be. Will redo.

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

We agree that the eccosorb serves to suppress the long-mode (5m) RF standing waves, consistent with coherent room reflections.
We still see some short-mode RF standing waves in the eccosorb trial - probably due to reflections from within the cal box. 
We ought to redo the baffle on/off trial due to the high noise in the very first trial. We will also connect the corrugated
horn to the signal generator and transmit a narrow band signal towards the cal box, and use the 
pyramidal horn to pick up any reflections. This is the time-reversed analogue of radiation building up coherently within the box 
and being picked up by the corrugated horn. This can be measured in real time.
