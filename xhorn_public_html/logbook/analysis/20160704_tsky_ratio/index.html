<H3>Intro</H3>
We attempt to verify that the sky power as a function of frequency varies linearly with airmass. We do this by calculating the ratio of $T_{sky}$ at some zenith angle to $T_{sky}$ at a nominal zenith angle (here chosen to be 20 deg). We then compare this ratio to an expectation value derived solely from measured zenith angle.
<p>
When I refer to the "measured ratio", I mean this quantity:
\begin{equation}
R\equiv\frac{V^2(\theta_z)-\overline{V^2}}{V^2(\theta_z=20^\circ)-\overline{V^2}}
\end{equation}
$R$ is calculated over an individual scan, i.e. $\overline{V^2}$ refers to the mean spectrum in that scan only. The purpose of subtracting this mean is to cancel out the additive contributions of $T_{sys}$ and $T_{iso}$ (e.g. galactic synchrotron and the CMB). We hope that
\begin{equation}
R=\frac{G\big[(T_{sky}(\theta_z) + T_{sys} + T_{iso}) - \overline{(T_{sky} + T_{sys} + T_{iso})}\,\big]}{G\big[(T_{sky}(\theta_z=20^\circ) + T_{sys} + T_{iso}) - \overline{(T_{sky} + T_{sys} + T_{iso})}\,\big]}=\frac{T_{sky}(\theta_z)-\overline{T_{sky}}}{T_{sky}(\theta_z=20^\circ)-\overline{T_{sky}}}
\end{equation} 
where the relation we seek to verify is:
\begin{equation}
T_{sky}=T_{z}\,/\cos\theta_z
\end{equation}
For this approach to work, $\overline{T_{sys} + T_{iso}}$ must equal $T_{sys} + T_{iso}$ for each $\theta_z$. The gain must also be the same for each measured spectrum, which we think is true as long as we're only looking at the cold sky (gain is linear on the order of $\Delta T_{sky}$). 
<p>
When I refer to the "expectation value", I mean this quanity:
\begin{equation}
\left< R \right>\equiv\frac{\mathrm{am}(\theta_z) - \overline{\mathrm{am}}}{\mathrm{am}(\theta_z=20^\circ) - \overline{\mathrm{am}}}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{am}\equiv 1/\cos\theta_z
\end{equation}
Again, the mean airmass is calculated over a single scan. It is evident that as zenith angle increases, airmass increases much faster. This is how we pick our scan angles to be linear in airmass. It is also the reason why uncertainty in ZA matters so much - 1 degree uncertainty at za=50 amounts to ~5% uncertainty in airmass. 
<hr>
<H3>Results</H3>
<b>Figures 1 - 4</b> show the quantity $R - \left< R \right>$ over ~30 hours of scanning for each $\theta_z \neq 20^\circ$, with the color scale railed at $\pm 1$. There is a clear state change at about 7 am local time on 6/30. This is not due to any human interference at the time, according to the logbook. Instead, I think this might have been because we power cycled the entire front end 12 hours prior, and it took 12 hours to return to a stable point. You can see the vertical stripes drifting down in frequency during the hour before the state change - this seems to suggest that the LO drifted up in frequency.
<p>
Figure 4 appears to bias high - this is corrobrated by the next few plots as well.

<b>Figure 5</b> shows the measured ratio in a nominal frequency bin (#1000) over time for each zenith angle, compared to the expectation values. This plot shows the presence of another anomaly at about 7am local time on 7/1. I suspect the timing is a coincidence. This plot also demonstrates how the standard deviation for a given frequency bin changes as you incorporate more scans. If we restrict ourselves to the rightmost half of the graph, the standard deviation is much lower. While it is essential that we are able to see anomalies, we also want to be able to determine what "stable" behavior looks like. For that reason, we will only include data from scan #600 onward for the next section.

<b>Figure 6</b> shows the mean of the measured ratio over the latter half of the scans (#600 onward) for each zenith angle, compared to the expectation values. 
<ul>
  <li>Error bands for the measured ratios are calculated as the standard devation over the time axis for each frequency bin.</li>
  <li><b>Edit: </b>Error bands for the expectation values are calculated by numerically propogating a $\pm 1^\circ$ uncertainty in zenith angle through to the ratio. The mean airmass is assumed to be unchanged by this uncertainty.</li>

<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<ul>
<li>The za=50 deg ratio is indeed systematically biased high. I suspect that this is due to the high uncertainty in airmass - especially when you consider that the apparatus could be off-balance at that angle. In other words, we are probably not actually pointed at za=50 deg - rather a significantly higher elevation. </li>
<li>This uncertainty is likely contaminating the other ZA's too. It would be worth our while to try and rebalance the ROACH in order to minimize sticking.</li>
<li>Only about half of the scans here were stable in time. That is bad obviously. We should continue to try and understand why the electronics suddenly change state.</li>
<li>I don't understand why there is structure in the measured ratio. Could it be that this will average out over longer integration periods? Or is it present because of gain nonlinearity or changes in Tsys over time? I will keep scanning with this setup to try and find out.</li>
