<H2>January 15, 2016 - Point Source Response</H2>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
  Bright point sources have the potential to impart additive distortions to a measured spectrum, because the antenna beamwidth depends inversely on frequency. This post outlines the analysis done to determine beam response as a function of both frequency and the point source's angular position.
<p>
  This analysis assumes that the eventual 2-4 GHz antenna will have a comparable profile to X-Horn's. It also does not yet weight the response with the spectrum of a real radio point source - I'll cover that in the following post.

<p>
  Comparison of the response per frequency band at different point source angular positions. At theta = 0, the spectrum is flat, because the beam is flat in the middle. You can see the feautures of the beam profile shift down in frequency as angle increases.

  Weighting of the beam response with a 5000K blackbody, just to illustrate how to get from beam response to foreground spectra. Radio point sources will have different spectra.
