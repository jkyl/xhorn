<H2>August 24, 2016 - More cold load calibration</H2>

<H3>Intro</H3>
We performed a series of cold load calibration trials in the lab with the intent to keep the baffle and horn
at the same temperature throughout the trial, so as not to induce a change in the horn's gain due to a change in
impedance. We wrapped the baffle in mylar and a towel and suspended it from the ceiling to try and reduce the amount of cold gas that got inside. We also attempted to induce such a change by pouring LN2 directly on the baffle.

<H3>Results</H3>
<b>Figure 1</b> shows the calibrated spectra for the suspended horn with baffle, mylar and towel. 
<p>
This trial appears to have slightly more pronounced structure than the non-suspended, non-mylar-and-towel version shown in figure 17 <a href="http://caelum.uchicago.edu/~xhorn/logbook/analysis/20160801_cold_load_cal/">here.</a>

<b>Figure 3</b> shows the effect of dumping LN2 directly on the baffle. It was calculated by using a previous calibration to generate calibrated spectra. It shows the difference between temporally adjecent mean spectra. 
<p>
LN2 was dumped at the 150th integration and stopped at the 400th integration. It seems as if the standing-wave-like wiggles begin to form there, and then fade as time goes on. 
<p>
We can take the means of fewer spectra to increase the time resolution of this plot at the expense of SNR. The 
wiggle behaviour is not as obvious in this case (3b). 
<p>
Figure 3c shows the same data as 3a, but animated in order to better see structure over time.

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

The baffle and/or the horn's gain does seem to be changing during these cooldown trials, as evidenced by the state change in figure 3 and the reduced wiggles in figure 2 compared to figure 1. <p>
It is unclear whether suspending the horn above the box or the towel and mylar did much to decrease the gas exchange, because of the slightly <i>more</i> pronounced features compared to the non-suspended, non-mylar-and-towel trials.
