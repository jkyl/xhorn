<br /><br /><br />Okay, thank you for the clarification. Since I will probably order more to
<br />
meet the minimum order, can I have quotes for the following:
<br />
<br />1 of 12LC - 2400 - S
<br />
<br />1 of 13IZ3 - 3000/2000 - S
<br />
<br />Can you also please confirm that the bandwidth is specified in MHz, e.g. is
<br />
2000 MHz for 13IZ3 - 3000/2000 - S?
<br />
<br />Thanks.
<br />

<br />Actually the price of the 13EZ5 is $760 for 2-5 pieces.  It was a typing
<br />
error on my part.
<br />
<br />The 9EZ5 is $580 for 3 pieces.

<br /><br /><br />Hi Gail,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Okay. Since that is the case, I will probably order different center
<br />
frequency filters than the ones I specified. I help me figure out how many
<br />
filters I should order to avoid wasting money, can you please tell me how
<br />
many of 13EZ5-10750/1660-S I would need to order so that the total price
<br />
was more than $1,500? (For two, the price is $1,500 / 2, so presumably I
<br />
could order 3 and the price would be the same.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Thanks.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />-Chris

<br />It actually has to meet the $1500 minimum.  If you are ordering only 1
<br />
filter the cost would be $1500

<br />
<br />Thank you. I'd like to order just the 13EZ5-10750/1660-S but it says $1,500
<br />
minimum order. Is this okay?
